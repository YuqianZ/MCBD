Pineapple plantations are implied to be fore exportation, but it's unclear where they're going. I put intercontinental, but that is a big assumption. 

Number of countries involved is also unclear for reasons stated above.

I chose intercontinental, but that was entirely a guess. 

Similarly, no idea how to deal with ""Number of countries involved"" when we don't know which countries the tourists are coming from. 

Number of time periods: Put 62 because that's the total number of surveys conducted. 

Metacoupling data type: Chose categorical because they compared reserve with tourists to reserve without tourists. ","Peru"
