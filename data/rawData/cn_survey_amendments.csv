44,,Habitat intactness,yes,The properties which conduct Biodiversity Economy Strategy (BES) have high total vegetation intactness. That indicates that implementation of the BES is likely to assist in conserving biodiversity.
1040,,,yes,"Bottlenose dolphins along the northern Gulf of Mexico continue to be impacted by numerous stressors including harmful algal blooms, infectious disease epizootics, and oil exposure following the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill."
1488,,,yes,Converting tropical rainforest to oil palm reduces bird species richness and abundance significantly
3456,,,yes,"Recreational diving may produce a press impact on overall benthic assemblage structure and composition in sub-aquatic tourism areas in Puerto Madryn, Patagonia Argentina."
3485,Invertebrates,,yes,Sites characterised as past high-use diving hotspot sites had lower mean percent cover of hard corals overall and of corals in the typically diseaseand disturbance-susceptible family Acroporidae
3583,,,yes,The disturbances caused by tourism affect directly the diversity and abundance of aquatic insects in the Sentinela stream.
3668,,,yes,"The global trade in freshwater turtles provides opportunity for parasites to be transported to new destinations which could impact the physiology, behavior and survival of native turtle species."
4574,,,yes,"The multibillion dollar cashmere industry creates economic motivations that encourages herders to increase livestock production which affects persistence of over 6 endangered large mammals in these remote, arid ecosystems."
5175,,,yes,Wetlands enrolled in the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) have the same avian biodiversity and effect in providing winter avian habitat  with reference wetlands located on public land in West Virginia.  
5804,Invertebrates,,yes,"At sites near development within the preserve, abundant  nonnative Argentine ant populations may be excluding native winter ants. "
6321,,,yes,Human trampling The densities of the total meiofauna and of the commonest groups were negatively affected in the trampled area due to human trampling by tourists on the northeastern coast of Brazil.
6655,,,yes,Ecotourism reserves along major rivers may act as effective faunal refugees and provide one of the few opportunities for the conservation of floodplain habitats outside strictly protected areas in a mosaic landscape threatened by bouncing populations of colonists.  So the ecotourism at Amazonian forest may improve the biodiversity.
