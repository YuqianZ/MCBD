I island. Because this shrimp, halocaridina rubra ('opae'ula), displays a preference for autotrophic components of epilithon, we hypothesized that tree canopy would reduce their body condition and abundance, but that this would be moderated by nutrient quality of leaf litter (high-quality, non-native, nitrogen-fixing tree vs. Low-quality, endemic non-nitrogen-fixing tree). We hypothesized that poeciliid invasion would reduce population size and body condition of h. Rubra by direct predation and by inducing reductions in feeding rate. Analysis of stable isotopes (delta d, delta c-13, and delta n-15) showed that direct consumption of leaf litter detritus supplemented h. Rubra diet in ponds with canopy cover. In addition, epilithon in ponds with canopy cover was isotopically more similar to leaf litter than epilithon in ponds without canopy cover, and our evidence suggests this may be due to contributions of allochthonous nutrient sources to epilithon assemblages. However, canopy cover, whether native or invasive, did not decrease epilithon growth rates and had little effect on shrimp body condition or population size. In contrast, poeciliid invasion reduced daylight grazing on the benthos, and caused a reduction in body condition among larger shrimp. Our results indicate that primary succession by invasive trees may shift food web linkages in these ponds from autotrophic to heterotrophic support, without negative impacts on native grazer/detritivore communities. We suggest that poeciliid invasions have sub-lethal effects on h. Rubra as well as their direct predation effects, with potential long-term implications for the ecosystem function of anchialine ponds and other coastal systems.",NA,1,2

We tested this classical climate change hypothesis linked to an important range shift which has attracted little research thus far. We analysed canadian fur harvest data from the hudson's bay company archives (14 trading posts; 1926-1950), testing hypotheses based on changes in summer and winter climates. Summer warming might have triggered a bottom-up increase in ecosystem productivity, while winter warming might have lowered thermal stress, both favouring red fox expansion. Additionally, we evaluated the hypothesis that red fox expansion was driven by the appearance of human sedentary sites (n = 110) likely bringing food subsidies into the unproductive tundra. Analysis of red fox expansion chronologies showed that expansion speed was higher during warmer winters. However, the expansions occurred under both cooling and warming trends, being faster during cooler summers in the baffin island region.

Validating the projected extinctions with iucn red list. We allocate projected extinctions to the agriculture, pasture, urban, and forestry areas used, traded, and consumed in 129 countries, using an environmentally extended global multi-regional input output database. Results show that for the three taxa combined, a total of 927 endemic species are projected to go extinct due to the impacts of current global land use. The taxonomic breakdown is 186 projected mammal extinctions, 170 birds, and 571 amphibians, with global agriculture land use responsible for 267 projected extinctions; pasture 314, forestry 313, and urbanization 32. Importantly, countryside sar projections compare well with the number of extinct and threatened species documented by the iucn red list. We found that land use for export production is responsible for 25% of these projected global extinctions. Our approach enables parametrization of countryside sars in any world region even without extensive field studies, and therefore allows quantitative assessment of biodiversity impacts under alternative land use scenarios.

Sand dune communities are worldwide characterized by high levels of biodiversity, but are often affected by human-induced impacts as those caused by tourist trampling. To understand the effects of human frequentation, trampling, and other human-induced impacts, fencing experiments have been traditionally carried out on coastal dunes. Since in touristic areas dune systems are subjected to different intensities of human frequentations rather than to opening or fencing, in this study we explore the effects of accessibility on vascular plants cover. This study tests the hypothesis that human frequentation on beaches affects spatio-temporal variability of vascular plant abundance on dunes by comparing the plant assemblages of high and low accessible sites in north-east sardinia (italy). Our results show that accessibility plays a crucial role in conditioning the percentage of vegetation cover in mediterranean dunes. In fact, not only we found a perennial vegetation cover that was significantly higher in the sites with low accessibility (and consequently low frequentation), but we also showed that at the sites with high accessibility there were significant differences in vegetation cover between times of sampling (cover was higher before than after summer): on the contrary, differences in perennial vegetation cover among times were not significant at the low frequentation sites. After summer, the difference among low and high frequentation sites in species composition and cover was >90%. Multivariate analysis identified those species that play a pivotal role in differentiating the low and the high frequentation sites.

Privately managed marine reserves (pmmrs) may be effective in areas where government enforcement is lacking. To determine if pmmrs are a viable alternative strategy to protect coral reefs, we surveyed and compared fish assemblages and coral coverage in national mrs in sanya, china to areas of reef privately leased to and managed by dive operators and hospitality industries. We found higher fish abundances and fish sizes in pmmr sites than in mr sites. However, while pmmrs are protected from fishing, other human impacts such as marine debris and illegal coral collection were evident in most tourist sites. Despite protection, long-term monitoring data of pmmrs revealed that in recent years, fish abundances have slightly recovered but species richness has not, indicating the need for a more comprehensive coral reef management plan. We strongly recommend coupling pmmrs with expertise supported regulations as an alternative coral reef management strategy in china.",NA,0,2

Tourism is one of these practices but it can also impact conservation and traditional resource use activities. Using a review of the international union for conservation of nature red list database as well as nature-based tourism, ethnozoology, ethnobiology, and wildlife conservation and trade literature, we examined the influence of tourism on the traditional resource use-conservation balance and the potential outcomes for species conservation. We identified 547 local culturally important species (lcis): 369 were threatened by traditional practices (e.g., hunting) and 161 were protected (e.g., totemic species). Most lcis were found in the indomalayan, neotropical, and afrotropical regions and roughly 30% were involved in nature-based tourism, particularly mammals. Very few lcis (<5) were threatened by tourism. Results suggested that tourism can support species conservation and protect traditional practices by providing alternative local sustainable development options.",NA,1,2

In this study, we investigated the use of knowledge by farmers to manage coffee (coffea arabica) agroforests and the consequences for the conservation of tree biodiversity and composition of surrounding forests. We interviewed 50 coffee farmers to investigate their shade tree preferences and sources of knowledge of the properties of shade trees and coffee management practices; we also conducted tree inventories in 31 coffee farms and 10 forest sites in la sepultura biosphere reserve in chiapas, mexico. Our results showed that farmers are modifying agroforests according to their knowledge and tree preferences, and that the resulting agroforest is lower in tree diversity and dominated by pioneer and farmers' preferred tree species as compared to forests. The principal sources of knowledge of management practices are external sources, such as governmental and non-governmental organizations, whereas the primary source of tree specific knowledge is empirical knowledge. We found that the higher proportion of pioneer trees relative to forest is mostly explained by farmers' tree selection decisions (63%) rather than as a byproduct of management practices (37%) that disturb the soil and open the canopy, altering light penetration and microclimate conditions. Based on interviews and tree inventories, we found that farmers gradually replace canopy trees of neutral and disliked species by preferred species, in particular inga spp. We found that external sources continue to promote the idea that inga spp. Trees bring significant benefits to coffee production in spite of a lack of scientific evidence to support this claim.

To better understand a substantial decline in the number of ducks foraging in the ecosystem over the past fifty years, we reconstructed a history of environmental change using oral histories, aerial photography, and field experiments. Our studies revealed profound environmental change throughout the 20th century that likely influenced the capacity of the ecosystem to support migrating waterfowl. Ironically, the unregulated discharge of industrial and municipal wastes and high rates of sedimentation associated with land use in the middle decades of the 20th century probably enhanced the extent and productivity of intertidal, emergent plant communities including key forage plant species. However, over the past 30 years, primary wastewater treatment and regional reforestation have reduced the rates of nutrient loading and sedimentation, thereby diminishing the emergent vegetation. Reinforcing this decline in emergent vegetation, a precipitous decrease in submerged aquatic vegetation between 1956 and 1981 was likely related to extreme water turbidity. The collapse of subtidal aquatic vegetation would have reduced the variety and quantity of food items available to waterfowl.
